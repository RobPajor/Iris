# About

This is my first ever Data Science Project, and I am really proud of it, since at the time I created this, I had only 
been learning about statistis and data-science for about a week. With this project, I created two models:

- One that classifies Iris flowers based on given features
- One that predicts a feature, based on the other 3 features
